python-pyxattr (0.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Bump debhelper from old 11 to 12.
  * Set debhelper-compat version in Build-Depends.
  * Fix field name typos in debian/copyright.

  [ Iustin Pop ]
  * New upstream version, officially dropping Python 2 support, which
    allows better compatibility with Python 3, e.g. Path objects support.
  * Minor refresh of packaging (debhelper compat, standards version, watch
    file version, etc.).
  * Drop the easy-doc patch, it is actually harmful.

python-pyxattr (0.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

python-pyxattr (0.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, with two changes that affect Linux and Debian:
    - Drop the use of the `attr` library, and instead switch to the glibc
      header `sys/xattr.h`, which is provided for a really long time now
      (since glibc 2.3)
    - Release the GIL when performing I/O, which can improve performance
      significantly on network or slow filesystems; slowdown on fast
      filesystems should be minimal (0-5%, in many cases negligible)
  * Usual updates to the debian packaging (new standards version, added
    rules-requires-root: no, debhelper compat version, etc.)

python-pyxattr (0.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixup building on hurd and kfreebsd; while neither of these
    architectures have proper xattr support, the package was present and
    importable on them previously (and hurd has some very basic support
    for xattrs)

 -- Iustin Pop <iustin@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:30:55 +0100

python-pyxattr (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, mainly fixing a race condition when
    listing/reading attributes during concurrent modifications (which
    required internal changes, see the NEWS file), and OSX support (not
    impacting Debian)
  * Fixup autopkgtests to also work when building the packages

 -- Iustin Pop <iustin@debian.org>  Mon, 23 Jan 2017 23:35:45 +0100

python-pyxattr (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Imported Upstream versions 0.5.4, 0.5.5 and 0.5.6; main changes:
    - fix multiple memory leaks in error handling paths
    - improve error message in case attributes disappear during retrieval
    - fix actual int/size_t issues (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1127310)
    - fix potential sign-compare issues (code is -Wconversion clean now)
    - fix potential name truncation in merge_ns()
    - fix building on systems which don't have ENODATA
  * Improve hardening of the package (all except pie, which breaks the
    build)
  * Migrate debian/copyright to DEP5-style
  * Switch debian packaging repo over to Alioth
  * Switch build system to dh and pybuild
  * Split the documentation into a separate package (Closes: #725419);
    note that the path to the documentation has now changed
  * Add autopkgtest testsuite; this would have helped the issue found by
    RedHat much earlier, since Debian runs on more platforms
